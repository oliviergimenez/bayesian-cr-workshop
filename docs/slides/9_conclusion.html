## Take-home messages and recommendations

???

+ We'll wrap up the workshop with a few take-home messages 
+ And recommendations for conducting your own analyses.

---
## Make the best of your data with HMMs

--

+ Here is [a searchable list](applistHMM.html) of HMM analyses of capture-recapture data.

???

+ We hope to have provided you with a useful overview of how to use hidden Markov models to analyze capture-recapture data. 
+ We have only scratched the surface of what you can do with these models. 
+ We have assembled a searchable list of HMM analyses of capture-recapture data to get inspiration. 

--

+ This list is not exhaustive, please get in touch with us if you'd like to add a reference.

???

+ It is not exhaustive, we'll continue updating it. Feel free to suggest papers to add to the list.

## Bayesian capture-recapture analysis with HMMs

???

+ Before we leave, we'd like to give you a few pieces of advice.
+ This is not rocket science.
+ Just a few things based on our own experience of Bayesian capture-recapture analysis with HMMS.

--

+ Make your ecological question explicit. 

???

+ First things first. Make sure you've spent some to time to make your ecological question explicit. 
+ This step will help you to stay on course, and make the right choices. 
+ For example, it's ok to use subsets of your data to address different questions. 

--

+ Think of observations and states first. 

???

+ Now in terms of modeling. Don't jump on your keyboard right away. 
+ Spend some time thinking about your model with pen and paper. 
+ In particular make sure you have the observations and the states of your HMM. 

--

+ Then write down the observation and transition matrices on paper. 

???

+ Then write down the transition matrix. You may act as if you had no imperfect detection. This is really what you're after, the ecological process (survival, dispersal, etc). 
+ Proceed with the observation matrix. 

--

+ Start simple, all parameters constant for example. Make sure convergence is reached.

???

+ When it comes to model fitting with Nimble, start simple. 
+ Consider all parameters constant. 
+ Make sure convergence is reached. 

--

+ Add complexity one step at a time. 

???

+ Then add complexity. Time effect for example. Or random effects.
+ Or uncertainty in the assignment of states. 

---
## Bayesian capture-recapture analysis with HMMs

--

+ Use simulations to better understand your model. 

+ Nimble models can be used to simulate data, check out [this tutorial](https://r-nimble.org/nimbleExamples/simulation_from_model.html).  

???

+ When it comes to model building, consider simulating data to better understand your model. 
+ You will always learn something on your model by seeing it an engine to generate data, instead of estimating its parameters.
+ The cool thing with nimble is that you can you models to simulate data. There is a tutorial for that.  

--

+ Do not try to optimize your code. Make it work first, then think of optimization. 

&gt; ["Premature optimization is the root of all evil"](https://stackify.com/premature-optimization-evil/) - Donald Knuth (creator of TeX and author of ["The Art of Computer Programming"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming))

???

+ Another advice, quite general in programming, is to not try to optimize your code
+ Or to try to make it elegant right away. Make it work first. 
+ Then think of optimization. 

--

+ Read [Bayesian workflow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01808) by Gelman et al. (2021).

???

+ More recommendations on Bayesian analyses in this recent paper by Gelman and collaborations. 
+ They offer a workflow for bayesian analyses.
+ In which they discuss model building, model comparison, model checking, model validation, model understanding and troubleshooting of computational problems.

&lt;!-- --- --&gt;
&lt;!-- ## Nimble --&gt;

&lt;!-- + [TO BE COMPLETED BY ALL] --&gt;

&lt;!-- + Go for `nimbleMCMC()` if standard needs.  --&gt;

&lt;!-- + Unleash full `Nimble` potential for improving MCMC or implementing new distributions.  --&gt;

---
## Till next time

--

+ The Slack space will remain for some time. Happy to answer questions you might have related to the workshop. 

???

+ The Slack space will remain for some time. 
+ We'll be happy to answer the questions you might have related to the workshop. 

--

+ Website will be updated with

    + video recordings
    + your feedbacks
    + a FAQ section based on your questions

???

+ We will update the workshop website in the coming weeks. 
+ With the video recordings of course. 
+ Any feedback you might have. Please get in touch with me if you have any, that would be great. 
+ Our plan is also to gather our exchanges in a Frequently Asked Questions section on the website. 

--

+ A book is on its way. More in 2022 hopefully.

???

+ And last, a book is on its way. Based on the material we used for the workshop and more stuff. 
+ Also half the book will be about case studies reproducing analysis from published papers. 
+ More in 2022 hopefully.
